# Sample Python program for tokenizer testing

# Using compound assignment operators
a = 10
b = 5

a += b  # Addition assignment
print('a += b:', a)

a -= b  # Subtraction assignment
print('a -= b:', a)

a *= b  # Multiplication assignment
print('a *= b:', a)

a /= b  # Division assignment
print('a /= b:', a)

# Using single operators separated by spaces
x = 20
y = 10

x = x / y  # Division with single operators and space
print('x = x / y:', x)

x = x * y  # Multiplication with single operators and space
print('x = x * y:', x)

x = x - y  # Subtraction with single operators and space
print('x = x - y:', x)

x = x + y  # Addition with single operators and space
print('x = x + y:', x)
